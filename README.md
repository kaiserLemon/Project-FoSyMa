This project is the main project of the course FoSyMa I've followed during the second semester of the M1 ANDROIDE at Sorbonne University. This project is about developing a multi-agent variant of the game "Hunt the Wumpus",one of the earliest computer games (Gregory Yobe, 1972). In the original version, the player's objective is to hunt down a monster, the Wumpus (or Golem), hidden in a cave while collecting treasures. In our variant, a team of cooperative agents must explore an unknown environment and collect as much treasure as possible. However, Golems (or Wumpus) are present in the environment to complicate the agents' task. We will use the multi-agent platform JADE, and more specifically the Dedale environment : https://dedale.gitlab.io/
